# kNN
The theory of k-Nearest Neighbor, program realizes in python, an example in Machine Learning in Action.

K-Nearest Neighbor is a kind of supervised learning method. 
The mechanism is as follows. 
With a given test sample, kNN finds the k nearest samples in the training test based on some kind of distance measurement such as the Euclidean distance. 
And then it predict the label of the test sample by the information of the samples found before.
